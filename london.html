<h2>VIII. The Dublin &amp; London Offshoot (1791 – Present): Migration, Anglicisation, and Five Generations in the Metropolis</h2>

<p><strong>1. Origins in Dublin and the Decision to Leave (c. 1791–1816)</strong></p>

<p>The offshoot begins with Thomas Kearey, baptised 4 December 1791 in Dublin to James and Mary. He came of age in the unsettled decades after the Act of Union (1801), when Dublin’s artisanal economy contracted under competition from English industry. Skilled young Catholics increasingly looked to London for steady wages and advancement; Thomas followed this current about 1816, never returning to Ireland (context from parish and family papers; see also general Meath–Dublin migration patterns in the period).</p>

<p><em>Occupations in London.</em> Early London entries describe Thomas as a baggage porter, progressing to gold refiner and goldsmith in the Clerkenwell–Southwark craft districts (family attestations and London rate-book extracts; compare the London craft milieu discussed in VIII.4 below). The sequence—porter → refiner → goldsmith—shows an artisan’s ascent predicated on literacy, numeracy, and trust.</p>

<hr class="soft">

<p><strong>2. Why “Kearey”? The Anglicisation of the Name</strong></p>

<p>The surname stabilises as <em>Kearey</em> in English records from the 1820s onward. Three mechanisms likely drove the shift from Irish <em>Keary</em> to English <em>Kearey</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clerical orthography.</strong> London clerks preferred the “ea” vowel graph to represent the mid /eː/ sound, producing <em>Kearey</em> from <em>Keary</em>. The same process generated <em>Keane</em>, <em>Keene</em>, and <em>Geary</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Occupational respectability.</strong> In gold refining and guild-facing trades, a consistent, distinct spelling functioned like a mark. <em>Kearey</em> distinguished the family from the very common <em>Carey/Cary</em> and aided identification in guild rolls, rate books, and contracts.</li>
  <li><strong>Social navigation.</strong> For Irish Catholics seeking clients in a predominantly Anglican city, an English-looking spelling eased everyday interactions without abandoning Irish pronunciation. Once established in legal and business papers (marriage entries, leases), the form propagated by inertia and was handed to descendants.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Five Generations in Outline (1791 → Present)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>(I) Thomas Kearey</strong> (b. Dublin 1791): emigrated c.1816; careers noted as baggage porter / gold refiner / goldsmith. Married in London; remained permanently in England.</li>
  <li><strong>(II) Thomas Henry Kearey</strong> (1820–1867): London-born son; married Hannah Raybould (1823–1878); journeyman goldsmith/assayer in Clerkenwell.</li>
  <li><strong>(III) Alfred Kearey</strong> (1854–1917): carpenter and builder; married Martha Sutton (1857–1947). Killed in France (1917) during WWI; three sons (Alfred Ernest, Frederick Augustus, Sidney Reginald) also died on active service—an extraordinary family sacrifice emblematic of London’s working-class war burden.</li>
  <li><strong>(IV) Albert Edward Kearey</strong> (1889–1971): Royal Engineers 1914–1920; married Elsie May Collins (1908–1969) in 1933. Lived Paddington → Kensington → Harrow; steady employment as a mechanical/engineering worker.</li>
  <li><strong>(V) Terence Arthur Kearey</strong> (b. 1935): son of Albert Edward &amp; Elsie May; the continuing London line to the present.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Interpretation.</em> The London branch illustrates a characteristic Irish Catholic artisan trajectory: technical skill substituting for land as the inheritable asset, with stable respectability achieved by the third and fourth generations. The WWI losses were grievous yet not uncommon among metropolitan families; survivor pensions and skilled employment underpinned the family’s post-war security. The <em>Kearey</em> orthography—by then two generations old—remained a quiet signal of British integration while preserving the Irish root in sound and kin memory.</p>

<hr class="soft">

<p><strong>4. Social, Religious, and Labour Context in London (1816–1971)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Religious life.</strong> Post-Emancipation Catholic parishes in Southwark and Clerkenwell offered schools, charitable societies, and marriage networks for Irish artisans. Keareys appear in parish rolls and rate books as respectable householders—a crucial status marker for craft workers.</p>

<p><strong>Work and mobility.</strong> The pathway from porterage to metal trades reflects London’s labour ladders: entry via dock/rail work, advancement into semi-skilled and skilled roles (refining, smithing, carpentry), and, by the interwar period, salaried technical posts in suburban workshops. The family’s moves Paddington → Kensington → Harrow mirror suburbanisation and social uplift common to Catholic Londoners after 1900.</p>

<p><strong>Identity.</strong> By the fourth generation, the line had fully anglicised in spelling and civic life, yet kept Catholic affiliation through marriage patterns and parish ties—an enduring echo of the Meath origin.</p>
