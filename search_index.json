      "text": "\n<h2 class=\"section\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">I.</span> Introduction and Purpose of Study</h2>\n This study reconstructs the Keary / Kearey family of County Meath across nine chapters, using headstones, civil registration, valuation sources, and census returns, and sets the genealogical findings within their social, religious, and economic contexts. The aim is both documentary—linking named individuals across proven events—and interpretive—explaining how wider change shaped those lives (¹).\n\n<h3>Method & Confidence</h3>\n Each linkage is graded (Proven / Probable / Possible) according to primary corroboration. Where civil, valuation, and epigraphic sources converge, we treat the connection as Proven. Collateral ties are clarified using informants (“niece Annie”), plot sharing (Bohermeen B‑294), and repeated forenames within constrained geographies (²).\n\n<div class=\"paper\">Scope: Martry → Durhamstown/Liscarton → Betaghstown/Bohermeen (farm line), and Dublin → London (artisan line), c.1730–1969.</div>\n<h3>Why a County Meath Focus?</h3>\n Meath preserves dense Keary clusters near Navan: Martry, Ardbraccan, Liscarton, and Durhamstown. This permits granular tracking of lease successions and collateral households, unusually well documented from 1821 onward (³).\n\n<h3>Editorial Note</h3>\n Spelling is preserved as on certificates (<em>Keary / Kearey / Karey</em>), with normalised anglicisation discussed in VIII.\n\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n General method statement. \n On informants and collateral confirmation. \n On the survival of early census fragments in Meath. \n</ol>\n"

      "text": "\n<h2 class=\"section\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">II.</span> Historical and Cultural Background (c.1700–1800)</h2>\n The Keary / Kearey name descends from <em>Ó Ciardha</em>, a southern Uí Néill line in the midlands. Through eighteenth‑century Meath, Catholic tenant strategies were shaped by estate economies (Earl of Essex holdings at Liscarton), tithe exactions, and the slow relief of penal disabilities. By 1800, parish clusters at Martry and Ardbraccan supported literate commemoration and intermarrying neighbour networks.\n\n Economic rhythms—tillage, flax bounties (Martry 1796), and periodic distress—help explain occupational mixes later visible in records: farmers who were also herds, outdoor servants, or day‑labourers; daughters in domestic service; and sons migrating to Dublin, then London (¹).\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n Flax Bounty Lists (1796) note “James Keary of Martry.” \n</ol>\n"

The inscription’s quality implies means and schooling (⁵).\n\n Thomas Keary (c.1766–1857) relocates to Durhamstown/Liscarton; Griffith’s Valuation records a house, offices, and c.13½ acres at Liscarton under the Earl of Essex (⁶). Revision Books annotate the transfer “Dead → to James Keary,” proving succession (⁷). O’Hart’s pedigree lists sons Luke, Hugh, James, echoed in later civil records.\n\n 1821 Dormstown households reflect Thomas/Anne with children Luke, Thomas, Anne, Bridget, in the orbit of later Durhamstown records; this fixes the geography ahead of civil registration (⁸).\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n Martry headstone transcription for Luke/Elizabeth/Anne/Thomas. \n Griffith’s Valuation (c.1854), Liscarton holding. \n Valuation Office Revision Books (Meath) — marginal transfer. \n 1821 Census, Ardbraccan (Dormstown) households. \n</ol>\n"
