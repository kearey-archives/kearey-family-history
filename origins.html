<h2 class="section"><span class="smallcaps">I–III.</span> Introduction, Origins & Early Durhamstown Settlement (c.1730–1857)</h2>
<p><em>Origins of the name.</em> Keary / Kearey descends from the Gaelic <em>Ó Ciardha</em>, ‘descendant of Ciardha’ (the ‘dark‑haired’), a southern Uí Néill lineage whose medieval homeland lay across modern Meath/Offaly. By the eighteenth century, occupational migration and estate rationalisation drew Ó Ciardha families into parishes around Navan, including Martry and Ardbraccan, where Catholic tenant households clustered beneath large Protestant‑owned estates.</p>
<p><em>Earliest anchor: Luke of Martry.</em> A carved headstone at Martry (Kells) records <strong>Luke Keary</strong> (d. 24 Oct 1806, aged 75), his wife <strong>Elizabeth</strong> (alias Rooney; d. 15 Feb 1813, 87), their daughter <strong>Anne</strong> (d. 24 Apr 1800, 28), and the son who erected the stone, <strong>Thomas Keary</strong> (d. 18 Jan 1857, 91), with his wife <strong>Anne</strong> (d. 31 Aug 1804, 82). The artistry and explicit kin terms imply literacy and modest prosperity, and—critically—identify Thomas as the next bearer of the tenancy line (¹).</p>
<p><em>Thomas at Liscarton.</em> Mid‑century records place <strong>Thomas Keary</strong> as tenant of a house, offices and c.13½ acres at <strong>Liscarton</strong> under the Earl of Essex (Winter Estate), as per Griffith’s Valuation (c.1854). Subsequent Valuation Office Revision Books note the marginal succession “<em>Dead → to James Keary</em>,” establishing the father‑to‑son transfer of the holding (²)(³).</p>
<p><em>1821 Census resonance.</em> The 1821 Ardbraccan returns capture several Keary households at <em>Dormstown</em> (Durhamstown), including a family headed by <strong>Thomas</strong> (50) with wife <strong>Anne</strong> (35) and children <strong>Luke</strong> (7), <strong>Thomas</strong> (0), <strong>Anne</strong> (5), and <strong>Bridget</strong> (2). Although early enumeration has gaps, the given forenames and location coherently anticipate the nineteenth‑century documentary chain.</p>
<p><em>Context.</em> The move Martry → Durhamstown reflects estate consolidation and the search for stable leases. Catholic emancipation advanced unevenly; tithe agitation and Famine shocks pressed tenant families to diversify labour (herding, seasonal hire) yet also to invest in durable kin networks around Navan chapels and markets.</p>
