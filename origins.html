<h2 class="section"><span class="smallcaps">I–III.</span> Introduction, Origins &amp; Early Durhamstown Settlement (c.1730–1857)</h2>
<p><em>Framing the problem.</em> The Keary / Kearey surname derives from Ó Ciardha (“descendant of the dark-haired one”), a sept of the southern Uí Néill associated with the midland territory of Cairbre before the Anglo-Norman settlement. Over the eighteenth century the name becomes visible in Meath parish clusters, particularly around Martry, Ardbraccan, and Navan. The earliest securely anchored ancestor for this reconstruction is <strong>Luke Keary</strong> of Martry, whose headstone provides a compact family record: Luke (d. 24 Oct 1806, age 75); his wife <strong>Elizabeth Rooney</strong> (d. 15 Feb 1813, age 87); their daughter <strong>Anne</strong> (d. 24 Apr 1800, age 28); and the son and erector, <strong>Thomas Keary</strong> (d. 18 Jan 1857, age 91), with Thomas’s wife <strong>Anne</strong> (d. 31 Aug 1804, age 82) (¹).</p>
<p><em>From Martry to Durhamstown.</em> By mid-century Thomas is found holding a house, offices, and c.13½ acres on the Earl of Essex (Winter Estate) at <strong>Liscarton</strong>, Navan Upper barony, as recorded in Griffith’s Valuation (c.1854) (²). The Valuation Office Revision Books for Liscarton subsequently note the succession on Thomas’s plot with the marginal legend “<em>Dead → to James Keary</em>,” thereby linking Thomas directly to a documented son, <strong>James</strong> (³). This chain—headstone → Griffith’s plot → Revision transfer—constitutes the backbone of the early Durhamstown/Liscarton settlement narrative.</p>
<p><em>Society &amp; economy.</em> These movements reflect the Catholic tenant experience on large Protestant-owned estates in Meath during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries: improving literacy (as seen in the epigraph), stable tenancies under estate oversight, and kin clustering around market towns (Navan) and chapel communities (Ardbraccan, Martry). The durability of the Kearys’ holding through the Tithe War (1830s) and the Famine era (1845–52) suggests a holding modest but resilient, probably aided by mixed subsistence (tillage and stock) (⁴).</p>
<p><em>Document summary.</em> (1) Martry headstone (Luke, Elizabeth Rooney, Anne, Thomas, Anne) (¹). (2) Griffith’s Valuation: Thomas at Liscarton (²). (3) Revision Book succession: “Dead → to James” (³). Together these place a Keary household continuously in the Martry–Durhamstown orbit from c.1730s birth of Luke through 1857 death of Thomas.</p>
