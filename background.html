  <h2>II. Historical and Cultural Background (c.1700–1800)</h2>

  <p>
    The surname <em>Keary / Kearey / Carey</em> derives from the Gaelic <em>Ó Ciardha</em>, meaning “descendant of Ciardha,” literally the dark-haired one.<sup><a href="#note1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
    The Ó Ciardha were an early sept of the southern Uí Néill, rulers of the Irish midlands whose ancestral territory of Cairbre extended through what are now counties Meath, Westmeath, and Offaly. After the Norman invasion of the twelfth century, their lands fragmented, and by the seventeenth century, branches of the family were dispersed as tenant farmers throughout Meath and Longford.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the Penal Era (1691–1778), Catholics were barred from land ownership and public office.<sup><a href="#note2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
    Families like the Kearys survived by holding small leaseholds under Protestant landlords, typically the Earl of Essex (Winter Estate) near Navan, or through sub-tenancy on ecclesiastical lands. Despite social restrictions, this period also saw the persistence of Catholic religious practice in rural parishes such as Martry and Ardbraccan, where secret Mass houses and hedge schools sustained communal identity.<sup><a href="#note3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    By the mid-eighteenth century, agrarian life in Meath was stable yet hierarchical: a small number of gentry landlords presided over a majority of Catholic tenants. Within this setting, Luke Keary of Martry, the earliest securely documented ancestor of the family, emerges as part of a modest but enduring rural middle class — a group resilient enough to weather famine, war, and political change.
