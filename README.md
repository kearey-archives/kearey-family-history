# The Keary / Kearey Family of County Meath (c.1730–1969)

_A genealogical and sociohistorical reconstruction compiled by **B. Kearey (2025)**._

This repository hosts a **static React (CDN)** website presenting the archival report and source evidence tracing the **Keary (Kearey)** lineage from **Martry, Durhamstown, and Liscarton (County Meath, Ireland)** to the **London offshoot founded by Thomas Kearey (born 1791)**.

The project integrates transcribed census data, civil registrations, valuation books, and contextual historical commentary to document the family from the eighteenth century to the mid-twentieth.
