<h2>III. The Early Generations: Luke Keary of Martry and His Descendants (c.1730–1857)</h2>

<p><strong>1. Luke Keary (c.1731–1806) of Martry</strong><br>
Occupation: Farmer / Leaseholder    Religion: Roman Catholic    Evidence: Headstone inscription, Martry Graveyard</p>

<p>Luke Keary’s existence is attested by an unusually detailed gravestone in Martry Churchyard:<br>
<em>“Erected by Thomas Keary in memory of their father Luke Keary who departed this life October 24th 1806 aged 75 years. Also his mother Elizabeth Keary alias Rooney who died February 15th 1813 aged 87 years. Also his sister Anne Keary who died April 24th 1800 aged 28 years. Also here lieth the remains of the above Thomas Keary who departed this life 18th January 1857 aged 91 years. Also his beloved wife Anne Keary who departed this life 31st August 1804 aged 82 years.”</em><sup><a href="#note4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The stone, inscribed with precision and care, indicates literacy and a degree of economic stability. The Kearys of Martry were not landless labourers but moderate leaseholders capable of commissioning a fine limestone headstone — a marker of respectability among Meath’s Catholic farmers.</p>

<p>Luke’s wife, Elizabeth Rooney, and his son Thomas (b. c.1766) represent the link between Martry and the later Durhamstown/Liscarton branch. The mention of “Thomas the erector” places the next generation squarely within the rural bourgeois class emerging after the mid-eighteenth century: Catholic families gaining gradual economic foothold despite legal disabilities.</p>

<p><strong>2. Thomas Keary (c.1766–1857) of Durhamstown and Liscarton</strong><br>
Occupation: Farmer (tenant under the Earl of Essex)    Spouse: Anne [surname unknown]</p>

<p>By about 1770, Thomas Keary had moved south from Martry to Durhamstown, a settlement near Navan known for mixed tillage and pasture farming.<sup><a href="#note5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> His tenancy is recorded in Griffith’s Valuation (c.1854), where he appears as occupier of house, offices, and 13 acres, 2 roods under the Earl of Essex in the parish of Liscarton.<sup><a href="#note6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>After his death in 1857 (aged 91), the Valuation Revision Books record a marginal note: “Dead → to James Keary,” confirming direct succession to his son.<sup><a href="#note7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> This single line, inked in red in Dublin’s Valuation Office, constitutes the bridge between the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Kearys, offering documentary proof of generational continuity.</p>

<p><em>Social and Religious Context (1760–1850).</em> The decades of Thomas’s lifetime witnessed immense transformation: the Relaxation Acts of 1778–1793 permitted Catholics to lease and later own land; the Act of Union (1801) bound Ireland to Britain; and the Tithe War (1830s) brought rural agitation. Families like the Kearys, secure yet subservient, stood between impoverished labourers and the gentry elite — a “middling” tier literate enough to navigate leases but still vulnerable to crop failure and rent hikes.</p>

<p><strong>3. Possible Collateral Kinsmen</strong><br>
O’Hart’s <em>Irish Pedigrees</em> (1892) lists sons of Thomas Keary of Durhamstown as Luke, Hugh, and James, aligning with recurring forenames in later civil records.<sup><a href="#note8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> These names persist in Martry, Durhamstown, and Ongenstown through the nineteenth century, suggesting a tightly knit extended family operating within a radius of six miles.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hugh Keary:</strong> farmer of Durhamstown, died 1907 aged 83.</li>
<li><strong>James Keary:</strong> plausibly the same “James of Martry” in the 1796 Flax Growers’ List — an early sign of proto-industrial enterprise.</li>
<li><strong>Luke Keary (the younger):</strong> potential ancestor of the Ongenstown line (see later section).</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these offshoots contributed to a web of interrelated households evident in the 1821 and later censuses, binding Martry, Durhamstown, and Liscarton into a single kin cluster.</p>

<hr class="soft">

<p><strong>4. The 1821 Census Households</strong><br>
The 1821 Census of Meath, Ireland’s earliest surviving nominal return, lists multiple Keary families across Martry and Ardbraccan.<sup><a href="#note9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Particularly relevant is the household in Dormstown (Durhamstown):</p>

<pre>
Thomas Keary, 50  | Head | Farmer
Anne Keary, 35   | Wife | Flax Spinner
Luke Keary, 7    | Son
Thomas Keary, 0  | Son
Anne Keary, 5    | Daughter
Bridget Keary, 2  | Daughter
Jane Clerken, 24  | Servant
Catherine Clerken, 24 | Servant
</pre>

<p>This household almost certainly represents Thomas (the son of Luke of Martry) with his young family — an invaluable bridge between the gravestone of 1806 and the Valuation entry of the 1850s. The household’s two live-in servants imply prosperity, while Anne’s occupation as flax spinner confirms engagement in cottage industry at a time when Meath’s rural economy combined agriculture with small-scale linen work.</p>

<p><strong>5. Summary of the Durhamstown Settlement (1730–1857)</strong><br>
From Luke’s first appearance in Martry to Thomas’s death in 1857, the Keary family evolved from modest tenants to durable local farmers. Their story parallels the slow emancipation of Irish Catholics and the stabilisation of rural life under improved tenures. When Thomas’s son James succeeded the lease in the 1850s, he inherited not merely land but a century of quiet perseverance — a legacy that would sustain the family through the upheavals of famine and reform in the nineteenth century.</p>
