  <h2>I. Introduction and Purpose of Study</h2>

  <p>This study reconstructs the history of the Keary family of County Meath, tracing its principal lines from the mid-eighteenth century to the late twentieth. Drawing upon civil registration, parish records, census returns, valuation office books, and grave transcriptions, it aims to demonstrate not only familial descent but also the social and economic conditions in which successive generations lived.</p>

  <p>The Kearys’ story encapsulates a broader Irish experience: the endurance of rural Catholic families through centuries of penal restrictions, agrarian reform, emigration, and adaptation. From Luke Keary of Martry († 1806) to William Keary of Martry († 1978) — and through Jane Foley (née Keary) of Bohermeen († 1969) — the record spans nearly two and a half centuries of continuity in County Meath, while its offshoots—in Dublin and later London—extend the family’s story into Ireland’s wider metropolitan world. The closing date reflects the final known Keary burial in Martry, marking the conclusion of the surname’s local presence while its descendant lines persisted through the Foley, Martin, and Mullen families.</p>

  <p>Methodologically, each claim herein is supported by primary sources. Relationships are graded as proven, probable, or possible according to the presence of explicit documentary evidence. Throughout, numbered footnotes direct the reader to the exact archival reference or online resource for verification.</p>
