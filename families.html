<h2>VI. Associated Families and Neighbour Networks (1900 – 1930)</h2>

<p><strong>1  The Leonard Connection of Ongenstown</strong></p>

<p>The Leonards appear frequently beside the Kearys in parish and civil records from the 1880s. The earliest securely identified link is the 1886/7 marriage of Luke Keary and Mary Leonard:</p>

<p><em>Marriage:</em> Luke Keary (35), bachelor, farmer, of Ongenstown; father James Keary (farmer). Mary Leonard (25), spinster, of Ongenstown; father Nicholas Leonard (farmer). Witnesses Patrick Keary and Mary Leonard. <em>(Civil Marriage Record, 1886/7)</em><sup><a href="#note1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Mary’s birth certificate (1871) lists her father as Nicholas Leonard and mother Anne Reilly.<sup><a href="#note2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Her age at marriage (about 25) aligns closely with this record, demonstrating ordinary registration variance of ± 3 years — typical when literacy was limited and ages estimated by family memory.</p>

<p>Mary’s death certificate (1935) records: <em>“Mary Keary, widow, aged 74, of Ongenstown; informant Patrick Leonard, brother.”</em><sup><a href="#note3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> This confirms that she was a Leonard by birth and that her brother Patrick remained nearby, sustaining intermarriage between neighbouring families in the Ardbraccan district.</p>

<p><em>Economic context.</em> The Leonards were smallholders and dairy farmers, part of the “strong farmer” class that prospered under the post-1881 Land Acts. Their alliance with the Kearys created a network of medium-sized holdings controlling roughly 30–40 acres across Ongenstown and Durhamstown — sufficient to sustain families without subletting, but small enough to require the labour of women and children.</p>

<p><strong>2  The Foley Connection of Kilmessan and Rathfeigh</strong></p>

<p>The Foley family, later linked through Rose Foley, appears in both civil and census records. Rose married a Keary of the prior generation (Luke) and became mother of Christopher Keary (b. 1866). Her death certificate states: <em>“Rose Keary, widow of a farmer, aged 82, died 1921 at Ongenstown; informant Christy Keary, son.”</em><sup><a href="#note4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The 1901 Census of Kilmessan lists another branch:</p>

<pre>
Residents of house 18, Kilmessan (Meath)
Francis Foley   45  Head  Farmer
Bridget Foley   30  Wife
William         10  Son
Julia            8  Daughter
Maggie           6  Daughter
Mary             4  Daughter
Jane             1  Daughter
Margaret        73  Mother
(Roman Catholic)
</pre>

<p>(National Archives of Ireland, 1901 Kilmessan return.)<sup><a href="#note5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The youngest, Jane Foley, is crucial: she later appears as Jane Foley aged 11 in the 1911 census of Edoxtown (Rathfeigh), residing with her aunt and uncle Peter and Jane Polian, recorded as niece.<sup><a href="#note6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Jane ultimately married and was widowed; her death certificate (1969/70) notes Kathleen Martin, niece, Slane Road, as informant,<sup><a href="#note7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> tying the Foleys into the later Martin family of Bohermeen.</p>

<hr class="soft">

<p><strong>3  The Polian and Magrane Households (1911)</strong></p>

<p>The 1911 Census, house 4 in Edoxtown (Rathfeigh), records:</p>

<pre>
Peter Polian    58  Head of Family  Roman Catholic
Jane Polian     56  Wife            Roman Catholic
Jane Foley      11  Niece           Roman Catholic
James Magrane   74  Uncle           Roman Catholic
</pre>

<p>This small rural household shows the intergenerational pattern of care typical of Catholic kinship: widowed or orphaned relatives (Jane Foley) were absorbed by elder kin (the Polians). The Magrane connection links back to farm-labour networks around Kilmessan, and the whole cluster demonstrates the durable Meath custom of neighbour-kin reciprocity, an informal social welfare system prior to the Free State’s public assistance acts.</p>

<hr class="soft">

<p><strong>4  The Martin Connection and Final Bohermeen Burials</strong></p>

<p>By mid-twentieth century the Kearys were represented chiefly by Jane Foley (née Keary) and her Martin relations. Jane’s 1969/70 death record identifies Kathleen Martin, niece, Slane Road, as informant.<sup><a href="#note7" id="ref7b">7</a></sup> Bohermeen church registers and the modern cemetery survey record adjacent Martin and Keary graves, implying continuing kin contact into the 1970s; specifically, St Ultan’s, <em>Plot B-294</em>, lists Anne (1943), Christopher (1945), Thomas (1954) and Jane (1969).<sup><a href="#note8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The social meaning of such proximity is significant: burial adjacency among related female-line descendants (Mullon, Martin, Foley) reflects enduring matrilineal memory even as the Keary surname waned locally.</p>
