  <h2>I. Introduction and Purpose of Study</h2>

  <p>This study reconstructs the history of the Keary family of County Meath, tracing its principal lines from the mid-eighteenth century to the late twentieth. Drawing upon civil registration, parish records, census returns, valuation office books, and grave transcriptions, it aims to demonstrate not only familial descent but also the social and economic conditions in which successive generations lived.</p>

  <p>The Kearys’ story encapsulates a broader Irish experience: the endurance of rural Catholic families through centuries of penal restrictions, agrarian reform, emigration, and adaptation. From Luke Keary of Martry (d. 1806) to Jane Foley (née Keary) of Bohermeen (d. 1969), the line of continuity is remarkable for its rootedness within a few square miles of Meath farmland, while its offshoots—in Dublin and later London—reflect Ireland’s participation in a widening world.</p>

  <p>Methodologically, each claim herein is supported by primary sources. Relationships are graded as proven, probable, or possible according to the presence of explicit documentary evidence. Throughout, numbered footnotes direct the reader to the exact archival reference or online resource for verification.</p>
